# PRD: Backlog

## Executive Summary

The backlog serves as a collection point for miscellaneous work items that don't fit within feature-specific epics. This includes bug fixes, technical debt, documentation updates, dependency maintenance, and other ad-hoc tasks discovered during development.

## Problem Statement

During development, teams encounter issues that need tracking but don't justify creating a full PRD and epic:
- Bug fixes discovered during implementation
- Technical debt that should be addressed
- Documentation improvements
- Dependency updates and security patches
- Small improvements and refactoring
- Exploratory spikes and research tasks

Without a designated place for these items, they either get lost or force unnecessary epic creation overhead.

## User Stories

**As a developer**, I want to quickly log bugs and issues I discover so that they don't get forgotten.

**As a tech lead**, I want to track technical debt separately from feature work so I can prioritize it appropriately.

**As a team**, we want a lightweight way to manage miscellaneous tasks without the ceremony of full PRD/epic creation.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Accept tasks without feature context
- Support all standard task properties (description, estimates, dependencies)
- Integrate with GitHub issues for tracking
- Allow prioritization alongside other work
- Support task lifecycle (open → in progress → closed)

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Zero ceremony - tasks can be added with single command
- No upfront planning required
- Tasks remain queryable and trackable like any other work
- Minimal cognitive overhead for developers

## Success Criteria

- Developers use backlog for ad-hoc tasks instead of creating throwaway epics
- Bug fixes and tech debt are tracked consistently
- Backlog tasks complete at reasonable velocity
- No loss of visibility for non-feature work

## Constraints & Assumptions

- Tasks in backlog may not have clear dependencies
- Priority may shift based on urgency (bugs, security, etc.)
- Some backlog tasks may later evolve into full features
- Backlog is ongoing and never "complete"

## Out of Scope

- Feature development (should have dedicated PRD/epic)
- Work requiring detailed planning or breakdown
- Tasks that span multiple domains (should be epic)

## Dependencies

None - backlog is independent of other features.
