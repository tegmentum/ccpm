# CCPM Roadmap Status Analysis

**Date**: January 15, 2025
**Current Version**: v1.0.0 (Plugin Release)
**Roadmap Document**: ROADMAP.md

## Executive Summary

The ROADMAP.md was focused on database optimization and reducing LLM usage through deterministic operations. Several phases have been completed, but the roadmap predates the plugin conversion work. This document analyzes what remains relevant for future versions.

## Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Database Foundation (COMPLETE)
- **1.1 SQLite Schema Design** ✅
  - 14 tables, 6 views, 3 triggers implemented
  - Schema in `lib/sql/schema.sql` (495 lines)
  - Documentation in `db/SCHEMA.md`
  - All validated in Phase 1 completion

- **1.2 DuckDB Integration** ⚠️ SKIPPED
  - Decision: Stayed with SQLite for simplicity
  - SQLite adequate for current use cases
  - Can revisit if analytics needs grow

- **1.3 Migration Tool** ⚠️ NOT NEEDED
  - Fresh installations use database directly
  - No legacy markdown files to migrate (in plugin mode)
  - Repository mode maintains markdown files

### ✅ Phase 2: Core Operations Refactoring (MOSTLY COMPLETE)
- **2.1 Database Query Operations** ✅
  - All commands use `db/helpers.py` for database access
  - Status, list, progress queries are SQL-based
  - Performance: <50ms for typical queries

- **2.2 Deterministic Operations** ✅
  - Progress calculation: Pure SQL triggers
  - Dependency resolution: `resolve-dependencies-json.sh`
  - Epic progress: SQL aggregates
  - Reference validation: Foreign keys

- **2.3 Issue Analysis** ✅
  - `analyze-issue.sh` implemented
  - Pattern-based file-to-stream mapping
  - 100% LLM-free stream identification

### ✅ Phase 3: GitHub Sync System (COMPLETE)
- **3.1-3.4 All Sync Features** ✅
  - Bidirectional sync implemented
  - Push/pull/status/resolve commands
  - Conflict detection and resolution
  - Issue number assignment
  - Comprehensive test documentation

### ⏳ Phase 4: Command Refactoring (PARTIALLY COMPLETE)

**Completed** ✅:
- Commands use database via `db/helpers.py`
- Router pattern reduces token usage by 63.5%
- All 39 commands work with database

**Remaining** ⏳:
- Explicit database management commands
- Export/import utilities
- Backup/restore commands

### ⏳ Phase 5: Testing & Validation (PARTIALLY COMPLETE)

**Completed** ✅:
- Plugin installation test suite (35 tests, 34 passing)
- Schema validation completed
- CRUD operations tested
- End-to-end workflow validated

**Remaining** ⏳:
- Formal integration test suite
- Performance benchmarks with large datasets
- Mock GitHub CLI testing
- Automated regression tests

### ⏳ Phase 6: Documentation (PARTIALLY COMPLETE)

**Completed** ✅:
- Plugin user guide (PLUGIN.md - 298 lines)
- Quick start guide (PLUGIN_README.md)
- Installation test report
- Screenshot guide
- Marketplace checklist

**Remaining** ⏳:
- Database schema documentation update (exists in db/SCHEMA.md but not linked)
- SQL query cookbook
- Advanced workflow examples
- Developer architecture guide
- Contributing guidelines

## Analysis: What's Left?

### High Priority (v1.1)
These enhance the plugin but aren't blockers:

1. **Database Management Commands** (Phase 4.3)
   - `pm:db-query` - Run SQL queries
   - `pm:db-export` - Export to markdown/JSON
   - `pm:db-backup` - Create backups
   - `pm:db-restore` - Restore from backup
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 days

2. **Integration Test Suite** (Phase 5.2)
   - Automated workflow tests
   - Mock GitHub CLI responses
   - Regression test coverage
   - CI/CD integration
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 days

3. **Documentation Polish** (Phase 6)
   - Link existing db/SCHEMA.md
   - SQL query examples
   - Architecture decisions doc
   - Contributing guidelines
   - Estimated effort: 1 day

### Medium Priority (v1.2)
Nice-to-have improvements:

1. **Performance Testing** (Phase 5.3)
   - Benchmark with 100+ epics, 1000+ tasks
   - Measure actual token usage reduction
   - Optimize slow queries
   - Cache optimization
   - Estimated effort: 2 days

2. **Advanced Sync Features**
   - Incremental sync optimization
   - Webhook support for real-time sync
   - Conflict resolution UI improvements
   - Multi-repository support
   - Estimated effort: 3-5 days

3. **DuckDB Analytics** (Phase 1.2 revisited)
   - Optional analytics layer
   - Complex reporting queries
   - Dashboard generation
   - Trend analysis
   - Estimated effort: 3-4 days

### Low Priority (v2.0+)
Future enhancements:

1. **Migration Tool** (Phase 1.3)
   - Only needed if users have legacy markdown
   - Could be community-contributed
   - Plugin mode doesn't need this

2. **Web Interface**
   - Visual dashboard
   - Browser-based management
   - Real-time collaboration
   - Not in original roadmap but could be v2.0

3. **VSCode Extension**
   - Mentioned in RELEASE_NOTES
   - Wrapper around plugin
   - GUI for common operations

## Obsolete Items

These are no longer relevant:

1. **DuckDB Integration** (Phase 1.2)
   - SQLite is sufficient
   - No analytics bottlenecks observed
   - Can revisit if needed

2. **Markdown Migration** (Phase 1.3)
   - Fresh installs don't need this
   - Repository mode maintains markdown
   - Plugin mode is database-first

3. **Command Removal** (Phase 4.2)
   - Commands are working fine
   - No need to deprecate working code
   - Sync commands integrated properly

## Conclusion

**Current Status**: The original roadmap's core goals have been largely achieved:
- ✅ Database foundation (SQLite)
- ✅ Deterministic operations (63.5% token savings)
- ✅ GitHub sync system
- ✅ Command refactoring

**What Remains**: Mostly polish, testing, and advanced features that enhance but don't block the core functionality.

**Plugin Release Impact**: The plugin transformation (not in original roadmap) added significant value:
- Token optimization through router pattern
- Dual-mode operation
- Automated installation
- Marketplace-ready packaging

**Recommendation**: Consider the original ROADMAP.md "substantially complete" and create new roadmaps for v1.1+ features based on:
1. User feedback after v1.0.0 adoption
2. Performance bottlenecks discovered in production
3. Feature requests from the community
4. Competitive analysis of similar tools

The focus should shift from "optimization and migration" to "enhancement and growth."
