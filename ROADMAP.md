# CCPM Optimization Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap tracks the migration from GitHub Issues as the primary data store to a SQLite database accessed through DuckDB, plus optimizations to reduce unnecessary LLM usage.

## Goals
1. Replace GitHub Issues with SQLite as primary data store
2. Make GitHub sync explicit, deterministic, and code-based (not LLM)
3. Reduce token usage by replacing LLM calls with deterministic operations where possible
4. Maintain all existing functionality while improving performance and cost

## Phase 1: Database Foundation

### 1.1 SQLite Schema Design ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Design core schema for PRDs, Epics, Tasks
- [x] Add tables for progress tracking, streams, analysis
- [x] Add tables for sync metadata and conflict resolution
- [x] Support arrays (depends_on, conflicts_with) via JSON or junction tables
- [x] Add indexes for common queries (status, epic_id, dependencies)
- [x] Migration strategy for existing markdown files

**Deliverables:**
- `db/schema.sql` - Complete SQLite schema (14 tables, 6 views, 3 triggers)
- `db/SCHEMA.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `db/query.sh` - DuckDB wrapper script
- `db/init.sh` - Database initialization script
- `db/test_data.sql` - Test data with complex scenarios
- `db/TEST_RESULTS.md` - Full validation report

**Validated:**
- All views work correctly (ready_tasks, blocked_tasks, epic_progress)
- Triggers auto-update epic progress on task changes
- Dependencies and conflicts resolve properly
- DuckDB analytics queries perform well

**Schema to include:**
- `prds` table (name, description, status, created, updated)
- `epics` table (name, status, created, updated, progress, prd_id, github_url)
- `tasks` table (name, status, created, updated, epic_id, github_url, parallel, issue_number)
- `task_dependencies` table (task_id, depends_on_task_id)
- `task_conflicts` table (task_id, conflicts_with_task_id)
- `progress_tracking` table (task_id, started, last_sync, completion)
- `work_streams` table (task_id, stream_name, agent_type, status, started)
- `sync_metadata` table (entity_type, entity_id, last_sync, github_updated, local_updated)

## Success Metrics

### Token Usage Reduction (Target: 30-50%)
- **Before:** Measure current token usage across all commands
- **After:** Measure token usage after optimization
- **Key Operations:**
  - Progress calculation: 100% reduction (pure SQL)
  - Dependency resolution: 90% reduction (deterministic graph)
  - Issue analysis: 30-40% reduction (pattern matching + LLM for complex cases)
  - Sync operations: 80% reduction (deterministic code)

### Performance Improvements
- Status queries: < 100ms (vs grep/find operations)
- Dependency resolution: < 50ms (vs LLM analysis)
- Sync operations: Batch GitHub API calls (fewer rate limit issues)

### Maintainability
- Fewer LLM prompt updates needed
- Easier to add new features (SQL vs markdown parsing)
- Better data integrity (foreign keys, constraints)
- Simplified testing (mock database vs mock filesystem)

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Start Immediately)
1. Database schema design (Phase 1.1)
2. Migration tool (Phase 1.3)
3. Dependency resolution deterministic script (Phase 2.2)
4. GitHub sync foundation (Phase 3.1)

### Medium Priority (After Database Live)

2. Pattern-based issue analysis (Phase 2.3)
3. Testing suite (Phase 5)

### Low Priority (Polish)
1. Database management commands (Phase 4.3)
2. Documentation (Phase 6)
3. Performance optimization

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Loss Prevention
- Always backup markdown files before migration
- Keep markdown export capability
- Maintain parallel systems during transition
- Extensive validation during migration

### GitHub API Rate Limits
- Batch operations where possible
- Cache GitHub data in database
- Only sync when explicitly requested
- Add rate limit monitoring

### Breaking Changes
- Version migration scripts
- Provide rollback mechanisms
- Clear upgrade path documentation
- Deprecation warnings before removal

## Notes

**Why DuckDB?**
- Full SQL support (better than SQLite for analytics)
- Can query JSON directly (for complex fields)
- Great for aggregations (progress calculations, etc.)
- Still file-based (no server needed)
- Excellent CLI for debugging

**Why Keep Markdown?**
- Export/backup format
- Human-readable audit trail
- Git-friendly for review
- Optional view layer (generate from database)

**Current Token Waste:**
- ~20-30% of tokens on progress calculations (should be SQL)
- ~15-25% on dependency checking (should be graph algorithms)
- ~10-15% on formatting/templating (should be string templates)
- **Total potential savings: 45-70% in coordination operations**
